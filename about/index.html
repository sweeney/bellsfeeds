		<h2 class="maintitle">About Us</h2> <p>The Bell family have been farming
Ullard Hall Farm at Toft near Knutsford for three generations <i>since
1943</i>.  The farm enjoys excellent quality soils and good storage
facilities for a wide range of crops suited to the locality.  The favourable
climate means that Cheshire is the ideal place for growing both grass and
crops together in a traditional mixed farming system.</p>

 <p>Father and son,
John and Robert Bell, run the farm and undertake both the management and the
physical work themselves.  The farm extends to over 500 acres.  It
produces milk from 200 dairy cows and grows around 300 acres of arable
crops.  </p>
  <p>The deep fertile soils of Cheshire, a mixed farming
system and a good supply of organic manure means that crops yield well and
are of outstanding quality.  Much of the land is well-bodied clay loams,
though there are smaller areas of sandy loams and even some semi-organic
'moss' soil.  This range in soil types enables crops and varieties to be
grown in conditions best suited to them - maximising quality.</p>

<p>Cropping for the 2007/8 season comprises Wheat, Barley, Oats, 
Peas, Beans and Forage Maize.  The cereals are normally sown in
September and October and the pulses and maize are sown in March and
April.
</p>
  <p><strong>Ullard Hall farm is a safe area for releasing
<i>trainers</i> due to the lack of overhead wires, please <i><a
href="./contact/" title="contact">contact us</a></i> for further details
about this.</p>
