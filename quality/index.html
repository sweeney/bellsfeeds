		<h2 class="maintitle">Crop Quality</h2>      <p>Careful planning and
husbandry enable high yields and excellent quality to be grown at Ullard
Hall Farm.  The aim is always to maximise quality by choice of rotation,
soil management, natural manures and careful control of husbandry during the
growing season.  </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Choice of variety for crop quality and
natural disease resistance.</li>
      <li>Seed stocks are carefully
selected and all crops grown are GM-free.</li>
        <li>Fertilisers and
crop protection products are kept to the absolute minimum.</li>

<li>All operations performed in-house for full direct control.</li>

</ul>
 <p>John Bell has won a number of Best Crop classes over many years
in the annual Cheshire Farms Competition.  In addition, all cropping,
storage and records are accredited by independent inspectors  in the Assured
Combinable Crops Scheme.</p>
  <h3 style="color : #249a00;">Care for the
Environment</h3>
      <p>Care for the environment is at the heart of sound
farming.  Without respect for nature, farmers would grow only a narrow range
of crops and quality would be very limited.  At Ullard Hall Farm, the Bell
family know and understand their environment.</p>

</p>
   <p>Situated in unspoiled countryside and surrounded
by woodland, it is hard to think that the M6 motorway and the conurbations
of the northwest are only a stones throw away.  Maintaining hedges and
landscape features such as field trees and ditches means that Toft is high
on the list of leading beauty spots in Cheshire.  Semi-natural grassland and
mixed arable-grass rotations mean that bird life is abundant.</p>

<p>Careful farming techniques including measured use of organic manures and
techniques for minimizing artificial inputs, means that crops and animals
are raised in a balanced and wholesome environment where welfare and quality
is at the forefront of production.
